**Project Title: Temperature Converter**

**Description:**
The "Temperature Converter" project is a Java application that enables users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. The program offers a user-friendly interface where users can input a temperature value and choose the original unit of measurement. Upon receiving this input, the program performs accurate temperature conversions and displays the equivalent values in the other two units. This program facilitates quick and accurate temperature conversions, making it a useful tool for students, educators, and anyone needing to convert temperatures for various purposes.

**Features:**
- Conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
- Interactive user interface with clear options for different conversion scenarios.
- Utilizes user-defined functions for accurate temperature conversions.
- Provides instant and precise temperature conversions.
- Displays the converted values in an organized and user-readable format.
- Includes error handling for invalid input and options outside the specified range.

**How to Use:**
1. Run the program using a Java compiler or integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the type of temperature conversion.
3. Input the temperature value and the original unit of measurement.
4. The program will calculate and display the equivalent temperatures in the other two units.
5. The results will be shown on the screen, providing a clear overview of the conversions.

**Advantages:**
- Facilitates quick and accurate temperature conversions without manual calculations.
- Enhances understanding of temperature units and conversions for educational purposes.
- Eliminates the need for external online converters or manual calculations.
- Supports learning about temperature scales and their relationships.

**Limitations:**
- Limited to temperature conversions among Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
- Assumes accurate user input for temperature values and conversion options.
- May not include advanced or specialized temperature scales beyond the standard ones.


**Overall, the "Temperature Converter" program streamlines temperature conversions, promotes understanding of temperature scales, and provides a handy tool for educational and practical needs involving temperature units.**
